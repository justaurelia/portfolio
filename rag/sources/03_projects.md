# Projects (selected)

## Personal portfolio website
Built my portfolio using React and Vite.
Used it as an experiment in storytelling, scrollytelling, and product narrative.

## AI experimentation
Built small prototypes to explore embeddings, retrieval-based systems (RAG),
and prompt design to better understand LLM behavior in real product contexts.

## Internal tooling
Created lightweight scripts and tools to automate repetitive tasks
around data analysis, content generation, and experimentation.
