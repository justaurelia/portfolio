# Values & Working Style

## How I work
I work best when I can own a problem end-to-end, from understanding the user need to shipping and iterating.
I like clarity on the goal, but flexibility on how to get there.
I’m comfortable with ambiguity as long as there is trust and accountability.

## What motivates me
- Building products that solve real problems.
- Seeing users adopt something I shipped.
- Learning continuously, especially around product, data, and AI.
- Turning messy workflows into clear systems.

---

## How I make product decisions
I start from real user workflows and constraints.
I favor small, shippable increments over big upfront designs.
I use data to inform decisions, but I don’t wait for perfect data to move forward.

---

## My collaboration style
I’m direct, respectful, and pragmatic.
I value honest feedback and clear ownership.
I enjoy working closely with engineers and designers and translating between technical and non-technical perspectives.

---

## How I approach AI in products
I see AI as a tool to reduce cognitive load, not to replace human judgment.
I care about explainability, control, and user trust.
If an AI feature doesn’t clearly save time or improve decisions, I’m skeptical of shipping it.

---

## What I value in a team
- Psychological safety.
- Clear ownership and accountability.
- Fast feedback loops.
- A bias toward shipping and learning.

---

## What makes work difficult for me
- Overly political environments.
- Decision-making disconnected from users.
- Process that slows execution without clear value.

---

## How I handle ambiguity and pressure
I break problems into smaller parts and focus on what can be shipped.
I communicate early when something is unclear or blocked.
I stay calm under pressure, especially when priorities shift.

---

## My definition of success
Success means shipping useful products, learning from real usage, and improving outcomes for users over time.
I care more about long-term product quality than short-term optics.
