# Profile — Aurélia Azarmi

I’m a product manager and SaaS founder based in Danville, California.
I founded Jucosa, an AI-powered bakery management platform, after running my own bakery.
My background spans software engineering, consulting, pre-sales, and product management.

I specialize in turning real-world operator problems into usable SaaS products,
with a strong focus on AI-assisted workflows, cost modeling, and production planning.

I’m looking for product roles where I can ship quickly, work close to users,
and build AI features that are practical, explainable, and valuable.
