## How I apply this
- I use my CS foundation to move fast from ambiguity → structure (requirements, tradeoffs, delivery).
- I use AWS knowledge to design pragmatic SaaS architectures (security, cost, scalability).
- I use ML training to evaluate AI features realistically: data needs, failure modes, and UX constraints.

## Quick answers recruiters ask
- **Why Berkeley?** I wanted a rigorous, practical ML foundation so I can build AI-enabled products responsibly.
- **Are you more PM or engineer?** I’m product-first with strong engineering depth — I can design, scope, and execute with technical teams.
