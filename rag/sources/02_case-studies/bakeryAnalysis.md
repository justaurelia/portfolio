# Case Study — Bakery Sales Analysis & Pricing Optimization

## Context
Before building Jucosa, I wanted to deeply understand bakery economics through real data.

## Problem
Bakery owners often price products based on intuition, without clear visibility into:
- cost drivers,
- margin differences,
- seasonal effects,
- product-level profitability.

## Approach
I conducted an end-to-end data analysis project using real sales data.
The goal was to identify patterns that could directly inform pricing and inventory decisions.

## What I did
- Analyzed 234,000+ sales records.
- Cleaned and structured raw sales and cost data.
- Identified margin drivers, customer trends, and seasonal variations.
- Built dashboards and visual reports for scenario planning.

## Tech & tools
Python, pandas, data visualization libraries.

## Results / Impact
- Identified underperforming products and margin leaks.
- Produced actionable insights for pricing adjustments.
- This work directly influenced the product direction of Jucosa
  (cost modeling, margin visibility, and pricing tools).

## What I learned
- Data-backed decisions outperform intuition.
- Even simple dashboards can unlock major insights.
- Operators need clarity, not complex analytics.
