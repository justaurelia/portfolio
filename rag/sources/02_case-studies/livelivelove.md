# Case Study — LiveLiveLove (AI-assisted writing app)

## Context
I wanted to explore how AI could support long-form, emotional writing without replacing the human voice.
Most writing tools focus on speed or snippets, not sustained reflection.

## Problem
People want to write memoirs or long-form stories but struggle with:
- where to start,
- consistency over time,
- maintaining motivation,
- shaping raw thoughts into coherent narratives.

## Approach
I designed a guided experience instead of a blank page.
The core idea was weekly prompts over one year, supported by AI for structure and editing—not authorship.

## What I shipped
- A web app that delivers weekly guided writing questions.
- AI-assisted rewriting and clarification using OpenAI APIs.
- User flows designed to encourage reflection rather than speed.
- Full product lifecycle ownership: design, implementation, bug fixing, iteration.

## Tech & tools
React, Redux, OpenAI API.

## Results / Impact
- End-to-end shipped product with real users.
- Validated that users want AI as a *writing companion*, not a replacement.
- Strong learnings on AI UX, prompt design, and long-running user journeys.

## What I’d do differently
- Add stronger progress visualization earlier.
- Improve onboarding to set expectations about time commitment.
- Introduce more customization in prompt pacing.
