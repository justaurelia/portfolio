# Case Study — Jucosa (AI Bakery Management SaaS)

## Context
I previously owned a bakery and experienced firsthand how fragmented bakery operations are:
recipes, production, pricing, inventory, and staffing live in disconnected tools or spreadsheets.

## Problem
Bakery owners lack a clear view of:
- what to produce today,
- how much it really costs,
- whether products are profitable,
- and how to plan production efficiently.

## Approach
I started with customer discovery interviews with bakery owners and pastry chefs.
I focused on real workflows, not “nice-to-have” dashboards.

I intentionally scoped a small MVP:
- production planning,
- recipe modeling,
- cost and margin visibility.

## What I shipped
- Recipe and product data model supporting formats and scaling.
- AI-powered cost analysis and recipe adjustments using OpenAI.
- Production planning views aligned with daily bakery workflows.
- Multi-language support (English, French, Portuguese).

## Results / Impact
- Functional MVP used by real operators.
- Clear validation of the production + cost problem.
- Strong learnings around scope control and iteration speed.

## What I’d do differently
- Narrow the initial feature set even more.
- Introduce usage analytics earlier.
- Ship value faster instead of polishing edge cases.
