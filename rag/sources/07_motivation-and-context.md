# Motivation & Context

## Why I moved to the United States
I moved to the U.S. with my family following a professional opportunity for my husband.
For me, it was also a chance to explore a new environment, learn a different market,
and rethink my own professional path.

Shortly after arriving in the U.S., I decided to open a bakery as a way to ground myself
in a new country, build something concrete, and gain firsthand experience running a business.

## Why I opened a bakery
I had completed a professional pastry certification in France as a personal passion project.
When I moved to the U.S., I saw the opportunity to turn that passion into a real business.

Opening a bakery felt like a natural way to combine creativity, discipline, and entrepreneurship,
while also giving me firsthand experience running an operation from end to end.
That experience later became the foundation for how I think about product, workflows, and real user constraints.

## Why I stopped running the bakery
What I enjoyed the most about running the bakery was the human side:
meeting customers, hearing they loved the products, training my employees,
and feeling the satisfaction of creating real value every day.

Over time, I realized that the operational rhythm required to sustain the business
was not fully compatible with the family lifestyle I wanted.
I also learned that I hadn’t yet built enough structure and resources
to slow the pace when needed, especially during weekends.

That decision helped me clarify where I have the most impact:
designing systems and products that create value for many operators,
rather than running the operations myself.

## Why product management
Product management sits at the intersection of users, technology, and business.
It allows me to combine my technical background, business experience, and user empathy
to shape what gets built and why.

## Why AI-enabled products
I enjoy working with AI because it opens new ways to think about problems and solutions.
AI tools make it easier to explore ideas, test assumptions, and iterate quickly.

More importantly, I see AI as a way to unlock creativity and decision-making for users,
especially when it removes friction or reduces cognitive load.
My focus is on using AI where it creates tangible value, not novelty,
and where it helps people do better work rather than replacing their judgment.
